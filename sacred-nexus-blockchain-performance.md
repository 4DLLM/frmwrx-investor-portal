## Technical Architecture Details

### Geometric Consensus Protocol (GeoSync)

The GeoSync Protocol operates through three primary mechanisms:

1. **Geometric Pattern Distribution**
   - Transactions distributed across 13 nodes following sacred geometry patterns
   - Each node maintains 6 primary connections forming perfect geometric relationships
   - Load balancing achieved through natural geometric optimization

2. **Resonance-Based Validation**
   - Validation occurs when geometric patterns achieve resonance threshold
   - No computational work required beyond pattern matching
   - O(1) complexity for consensus operations

3. **Instant Finality**
   - Blocks achieve finality upon geometric pattern completion
   - No probabilistic confirmation delays
   - Deterministic security through geometric verification
